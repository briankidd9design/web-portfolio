            <p>
              Hello, my name is Brian Kidd and I am a Web and Multimedia
              Developer. But what exactly does that mean?
            </p>
            <p>
              Put succinctly, it means that I specialize in Web Design and
              Development, UX Design, Web Content Writing and Editing, and Audio
              and Video Production.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a writer, it means that I love to write and edit web content. I
              earned my first degree in Journalism from the University of
              Washington and was awarded The Excellence in Journalism from The
              Department of Communication. However, with regards to my career,
              writing is not the entire picture but a very important part of it.
            </p>
            <img
              src="assets/images/brian-kidd-profile-pic.jpg"
              class="center-block img-responsive"
              id="profileImage"
              alt="Brian Kidd"
            />
            <p>
              As a musician and videographer it means I have an affection for
              audio and video production. Since owning my first Tascam 424 four
              track music recorder and also my first camcorder as a kid, I have
              been writing, recording and producing music and video content.
              Currently, I play and produce music in an electronic music act
              called
              <a href="https://www.kylmyys.com" target="_blank">Kylmyys </a>and
              besides live performances we independently produce music for TV,
              film and radio and create music videos. However, like writing,
              audio and video production is not the entire picture, but a very
              important part of it.
            </p>
            <p id="webDevelopingAboutMe">
              Although I have a great affinity for the aforementioned fields, it
              was my introduction to the Web, and the many multimedia
              possibilities that it offered, that piqued my interest in Web
              Design and Development. To create beautiful websites, some with
              pictures, music, videos, articles et-cetera, seemed like an
              impossible feat at first, especially since I had not written one
              line of code until I was well into my 20s. However, I bought an
              O'Reilly book about HTML, signed up for a Tripod account (yes I
              wrote 'Tripod') and as most noob programmers do, I typed in the
              phrase "Hello World!" into the text editor. Once I saw those words
              live for anyone online in the entire world to see, my eyes widened
              as I knew this would be the beginning of a lifelong dedication to
              contributing quality content to the Web, with both passion and
              precision.
            </p>
            <p>
              After receiving a degree in Web Application Programming and
              several programming certs, the picture of my career path is
              complete. Currently my concentrations are on UX Engineering and
              Front End Design and Development–along with UX Design. Please See
              my CV below for more information.

              <h4>HTML5</h4>
              <p>
                The essential markup language to build any website. An analogy I
                use for HTML is that the language is a tool to frame a website
                like you might frame a house. The HTML itself is like the actual
                frame of the house in that a house has rooms containing
                different things (e.g. furniture and appliances) and a website
                has different sections created by HTML (e.g. header, body,
                footer) that contain different things such as images, text, and
                forms.

              <h4>CSS3 and SASS</h4>
              <p>
                I love using CSS3 to style websites and make them responsive on
                all devices. An analogy I use for CSS is that it can be used to
                style the different sections of a website like you might style
                the different rooms of a house. For example, rooms, like
                sections might vary in size. Moreover, a room might have
                different pictures or paintings on the wall that are different
                sizes with possibly different frames and colors, much like the
                images of a section might have different sizes, colors, and
                borders.

              <h4>JavScript/Node.js/React.js</h4>
              <p>
                JavaScript adds dynamic features to a website and allows for
                user interaction. It can even be used server-side with the
                asynchronous language Node.js. JavaScript allows the user to
                interact with the website like the switches, gadgets, and
                appliances in a home. For a simple example, when a visitor
                pushes the doorbell of a house and the occupant asks "Who is
                it?" and the person replies with her or her name. This is like
                if a JavaScript eventListener is added to an HTML element, and
                after the user clicks on that element, a prompt box appears
                asking for the user's name.

              <h4>PHP</h4>
              <p>
                PHP is used to communicate with databases and retrieve data to
                be displayed on a website. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP are
                what I consider the Fab Four of what every Front End Developer
                should know. This is because PHP is like electricity or even
                data that is delivered to a home. For example, you might sign in
                to your YouTube account to watch videos, much like you might
                sign into your NetFlix account on your TV to stream videos as
                well.

              <p>
                I love the psychological aspects of UX Design in that it
                emphasizes what the user experiences while navigating through a
                website and how these experiences make the user feel and behave.
                A UX designer could be compared to the architect or interior
                designer of a house. Although UX Design is a separate field from
                Front End Development, I believe that communicating effectively
                with UX Designers is an important part of being an excellent
                Front End Developer.

                  <h2>NCAA Basketball March Madness Game Predictor</h2>
                  <p>
                    As a huge basketball fan, I am very competitive when it
                    comes to my NCAA Basketball March Madness bracket
                    challenges. Each year I fill a Google spread sheet with
                    important statistical data of each team that participates in
                    the tournament. This spreadsheet is hosted by a service
                    called SheetDB that cteates a JSON API endpoint for all my
                    data. I programmed the site with JavaScript implementing
                    both a popular basketball game predictor formula along with
                    my own statistical comparisons. I designed the UI of this
                    app using Figma.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Currently, this app is still being developed, but the user
                    can enter in any two teams that participated in the 2024
                    Tournament and get a score prediction. The user can also see
                    all the available stats of each team, which are updated
                    before every tournment by filling in the Google Sheet. Since
                    the API endpoint is connected to a living spreadsheet, it is
                    very easy for me to add new stats like injuries and All
                    Americans on the roster and then update the JavaScript and
                    markup to show the new data. I hid the API key by using
                    Node.js and an Express proxy server.
                  </p>

                    Currently, all the pages of this site are finished. However
                    the Forum page is still in beta and should be modified to
                    version 1.0.0 by the 2025 March Madness Tournament.

                  <p>
                    As part of a large website migration project, I built a
                    support page for Pacific Software Publishing's (PSP)
                    WebdeXpress, website building tool. PSP had separate sites
                    for their products and services. In order to improve SEO,
                    page views, and decrease bounce rate, the company migrated
                    all its sites under the

                    This was a fun and challenging project because I had to in
                    effect transfer the PHP and JavaScript from one emvironment
                    to a totally different one. Then I used JavaScript to create
                    the repsonsive side navigation with accordion-like drop-down
                    usability and features.

                  <p>
                    I adjusted the review section for this mom and pop diner.
                    Now the reviews are loaded from the Yelp Fusion API using an
                    Express Proxy Server. The reason I had to use an Express
                    proxy in Node, is because the Yelp Api does not allow Cross
                    Origin Resource Sharing(CORS) requests with the
                    Access-Allow-Control-Origin header for authorization. By
                    using a proxy server, I was able to circumvent the CORS
                    restriction. Notice, the Yelp API only shows previews of the
                    top three reviews, so I also linked to the entire review on
                    Yelp.

                    As part of the Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree, I
                    used JavaScript objects and methods to program a game called
                    Phrase Hunter. The object of the game is to guess the
                    letters of the phrase before getting five wrong. I added a
                    keyUp event listener so that the user can use the keyboard,
                    and not just the mouse cursor, to enter guesses.

                    Christy is a licensed acupuncturist and wanted an
                    aesthetically pleasing and responsive site that would be an
                    improvement on the website she built using Weebly. I built
                    this website in 2017 using Mobirise because I wanted
                    experience using a native website builder and liked the
                    simple yet elegant designs in their template library. By
                    modifying the original template I was able to create a
                    website that suited my wife's needs. She has since decided
                    to use Squarespace because she doesn't want to have to keep
                    asking me to make changes to the website when she needs
                    them. She would rather just make them herself. Hey, my
                    clients are always the boss...!

                  <h2>High Fidelity Mockup for a Food Charity</h2>
                  <p>
                    The client asked me to rework the medium fidelity mockup I
                    submitted to them and create a high fidelity color mockup.
                    As part of my process I created a triadic color palette that
                    includes earthtones from which I picked three—see
                    deliverables. The charity sent me the basic requirements for
                    the the layout. The founder of the charity was comfortable
                    with me not only making the design but also composing the
                    prose for the design. She requested that the design conveys
                    the urgency of fighting world hunger but also to make sure
                    that the fun aspects of the charity are depicted as well.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    One of the biggest things I learned when designing this site
                    is that oftentimes a little color goes a long way,
                    especially with colors that are further apart on the color
                    wheel. The blue and the green go together very well even
                    when used liberally. On the other hand, the orange-red
                    color, although part of the triadic color scheme, worked
                    best when used sparingly for inner borders and buttons. I
                    discovered that I really like the triadic color scheme in
                    that it is an effective way of finding colors that work when
                    used both liberally and sparingly.

                  <p>
                    A medium-fidelity wireframe/mockup for an organization that
                    fights world hunger. The organization wanted the personality
                    traits of Honesty, Compassion, Respect, and Service to
                    Others to really shine through for their website. Also, they
                    wanted the design to have Inspirational, Descriptive, and
                    Transparent UX Content as well.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To illustrate why fighting world hunger is important, I used
                    both global and national hunger statistics to create a sense
                    of urgency and also a call-to-action for the site visitor to
                    donate. I also included transparent, inspirational, and
                    descriptive UX Design content in the mockup. The client
                    liked the mockup and hired me to create a high-fidelity
                    color mockup.

                  <h2>Med Fidelity Blog Wireframe</h2>
                  <p>
                    A baking supply company asked me to create two iterations of
                    a blog design: one that emphasizes their baking supplies and
                    the other that emphasizes tech-savvy elderly women, their
                    biggest client. I solved the first problem by featuring the
                    baking supplies used for a particular recipe in the blog
                    design. The second problem, I decided to feature top elderly
                    female chefs who had contributed recipes to the blog.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By creating the two iterations for the client, I learned how
                    to tie in different aspects of a company in a design to
                    emphasize its different offerings. Ideally, this would
                    change user behavior in that for the first design iteration,
                    the visitor would become more aware of the baking supplies
                    the company offers and would potentially purchase some of
                    those goods and in the second iteration, the site might
                    attract its biggest in-store customer, tech-savvy elderly
                    women.

                  <h2>Weather App Prototype</h2>
                  <p>
                    The client asked me to create a prototype for a weather app.
                    They requested that the deliverable should be a
                    high-fidelity prototype that includes the current weather
                    along with the forecast of upcoming days. When a specific
                    day is selected, a new screen will appear with the weather
                    specifics for that day including the low and high
                    temperatures and chance of precipitation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This was my first time creating an interactive prototype in
                    Figma and I thoroughly enjoyed the process of designing the
                    app and then making it interactive with the prototype. I
                    also discovered that Font Awesome is a great resource for
                    free UX Design icons. Also, I learned users can intuitively
                    decipher images much faster than words. For instance,
                    instead of using an H or L for low and high temperatures, by
                    simply changing the color of the number to red and blue, the
                    same information is conveyed in a more aesthetically
                    pleasing manner.

                  <p>
                    Sometimes with high-end UX Design tools, it is easy to get
                    too detailed when creating wireframes. A pet adoption agency
                    hired me to create a super simple wireframe for the desktop,
                    tablet, and mobile views of a pet adoption form. After
                    determining the stakeholders, audience, and goal of the
                    form, I created a wireframe of the form using Balsamiq,
                    which is a tool that really lends itself specifically to
                    creating effective wireframes.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I had some preconceived ideas about how I was going to
                    create a wireframe for the adoption form. However, I found
                    it was much better to consider the needs stakeholders,
                    audience, and goals of the form before I began drafting the
                    wireframe.

                  <h2>Medium Fidelity Wireframe/Mockup</h2>
                  <p>
                    The client hired me to create a user flow for a hiking
                    application. The goals for the business are to create
                    healthier communities and more active individuals by giving
                    people an easy way to schedule a hike, increase the number
                    of hikes users go on, and increase the number of app
                    downloads. Using the card sort located in the Deliverables,
                    I was able to create an effective workflow of two different
                    user personas.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    During the process of creating the user flow, I was able to
                    empathize more with the two personas and visualize the
                    specific needs each user might have. For instance, one
                    persona wants to be able to schedule hikes with his busy
                    friends and the other persona wants to be able to meet new
                    people while hiking. I included both capabilities in the
                    user flow and subsequently the wireframe itself.

                  <h2>Blog Wireframe</h2>
                  <p>
                    A baking supply company asked me to create a low-fidelity
                    wireframe that emphasizes recipes and the supplies they
                    sell. The company came up with the basic requirements for
                    the layout, which seemed limiting to me because I could only
                    design how the blog would look above the fold and the header
                    section is small, making it difficult to incorporate a
                    traditional desktop nav—I opted for a hamburger nav.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The company liked the wireframe I created but looking at it
                    now, I would probably write the word MENU over the hamburger
                    nav to make it clearer what those three lines mean and I
                    might even consider a more traditional desktop nav. I
                    understand that sliders and carousels are often lowly
                    regarded because of clickability rates, but in the context
                    of a baking blog, I feel that they can be effective. I would
                    consider using an expandable list to replace the sliders in
                    the future. In order to get users to buy the company's
                    baking supplies, I made sure to include advertisements in
                    the aside portion of the design.

                  <h2>Research for a Grocery Store App</h2>
                  <p>
                    The client needed me to conduct interviews with grocery
                    shoppers to determine their main pain points and develop a
                    proposal for a grocery app based on those pain points.
                    Participants were found using social media with a notice
                    solciting primary shoppers of households to take part in a
                    shopping study that is being conducted in order determine
                    what features of a grocery store app might make grocery
                    shopping easier and more enjoyable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    What was really revealing to me during this project was that
                    it is best to let the subject lead the interview and that
                    the best responses you get are often from broad rather than
                    specific questions. Of course, you do not want to ask too
                    broad of questions, but questions that make the user share
                    unique, personal details about what you are asking. I used
                    some of the participants' statements to create an affinity
                    diagram as pictured here. I used the statements to create
                    categories and then I placed the relevant statements under
                    each category.

                    Based on my research, the client created a prototype of
                    their grocery store app and hired me to conduct usability
                    tests to determine if the user could complete a simple task.
                    The participant was asked to choose bananas, place the
                    bananas in the cart, and then view the cart at checkout. I
                    had all the participants speak aloud as they attempted to
                    complete the task and was able to make recommendations for
                    improving the prototype based on participants' feedback.

                    This project showed me the importance of usability testing

                    different user personalities, it is extremely difficult to
                    predict what pain points the user might run into. For
                    instance, when participant 3 pointed out that the number of
                    bananas is not shown on the second screen, I was impressed
                    and surprised by her observation. I included her input in my
                    deliverables to the client.

                    UX Design Critique of two websites, including color
                    critiques and empathy maps
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    A company called Shirts 4 Mike hired me to critique their
                    website using UX Design principles. In addition to
                    determining the site's goal and target user, I broke the
                    site down into the UX design principles of color, shapes,
                    grouping, and balance and organization. I also created an
                    empathy map of what a potential site visitor does, thinks,
                    says, and feels in order to determine the effectiveness of
                    the website and offer suggestions to improve it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The most important thing I learned while critiquing the site
                    was that the pictures and images of a website can be equally
                    as important as the word content. In this case, I suggested
                    that the client create an About tab to describe in more
                    concise language what Shirts 4 Mike actually is.

                  <h2>Steve's Cafe</h2>
                  <p>
                    When I started attending Cascadia College in 2013, I took
                    part in a group project to build a simple website for a
                    local business. Steve's Cafe was a Mom and Pop diner on Main
                    Street in Bothell, WA. Originally, my group used a template
                    from CSS3 Templates to build the website. The owner liked
                    the website, but I decided that it did not look very good on
                    mobile or monitors with larger screen resolutions like 1920
                    X 1080. So as part of an internship project the following
                    year, I incorporated some of the code from the template and
                    used the HTML 5 Boilerplate Framework to rework the website
                    to make it responsive. I also added a simple reviews form
                    and used JavaScript and jQuery to make a clickable reviews
                    section.

                  <h2>Online Developer Plus - Website to Attract Investors</h2>
                  <p>
                    A pair of Microsoft alumni founded an online programming
                    school and hired me to create a website so they could pitch
                    their company to investors. Using some of the content from
                    their previous website that was not attracting investors, I
                    decided that due to time constraints, I would use a template
                    that I created for a similar business, which uses the
                    Bootstrap Framework for responsive design. The client was
                    very pleased with the result and what was originally used as
                    a website to attract investors slowly morphed into a website
                    to attract students. However, the website eventually
                    attracted an investment group and the programming school
                    (ondevplus.com) is starting to enroll students. My website
                    helped the company attract a strong investor.
